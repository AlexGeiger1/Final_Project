# Stock Trends VS US Economic Factors

## Overview: 

### Purpose:  The purpose of this analysis is to look at how US macro economic factors, such as the Federal Reserve interest rates, impact stock prices.  The topic was selected because team members are interested in which industries are the most affected by various economic variables.

### Objective:  Using a neural network model for Machine Learning along with historical stock and selected economic data, the economic factors are analyzed for their affect within each chosed industry sector.  The objective is to predict which industries may be the most stable for investment purposes.

## Questions the Team Members are Trying to Answer:
1.  Is there any industry that is more or less affected by the econmy.
2.  If so, which industries and what factors are correlated these effects?
