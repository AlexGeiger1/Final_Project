# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate HTML to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is sklearn train_test_split. We will also use sklearn StandardScaler to scale the features.

## Dashboard
In addition to using a HTML template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on tableau.
