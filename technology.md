# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
SQL will be used to merge all csv file from ticker makeup branch and clean all different database for our research analysis. We will extract data we only need. The reason we chose SQL database is we have fixed rows and columns from csv file and the time of reading the data is fast and easier since we dont have a lot of data and not use for rapid application. SQL programming can be effectively used to insert, search, update and delete database records among the other database programs.

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use for our database. It is easy to handle complex quries and massive database. PostgreSQL not only store information about tables and columns, also define data types, index types, and functional languages.

## Machine Learning
Neural network (KNN) in Unsupervised Machine learning will be used for our analysis. We are going to create perceptron structure and input the data based on our extracted database. Based on the input, we will see what tickers in which sectors would be the most stable over time in the US.

## Dashboard
Tableau will be used to show our analysis visually. It is easy to connect several data sources in case if we need to add more in our anaylsis and easy to transform data by dragging and dropping fields into the view. Also our team can share visualizations online easily.
